Randomly pick a word for the user to guess
	If this word is the same as the previous word, pick a different word
Based on the length of the word, set the number of guesses the user can guess
Display a number of _ equal to the length of the word
When a user hits a key, first check that the key is a letter
	If it wasn't, ignore it and ask the user for a valid guess
	If it was, proceed to the next step
Check to see if the user's guess is one of the letters of the word
	If it was, display the letter in the appropriate location(s) of the word
	If it wasn't, do nothing
In either case, increment the number of guesses that the user has made and/or decrement the number of guesses the user has guessed
Also, display the letter that the user guessed
If all letters have been successfully guessed, the user wins and the win count should be incremented
If the user runs out of guesses, the user loses and the loss count should be incremented
In both cases, the word should be displayed on the screen
Start a new game by randomly picking a new word

Extra:
Allow the user to pick a difficulty level
	Easy has the highest number of available guesses
	Medium lowers the number of available guesses
	Hard has the lowest number of available guesses
