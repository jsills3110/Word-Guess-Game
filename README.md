# Hangman National Park

### A Word Guess Game
Hangman National Park is a Hangman-style word guessing game. Players must guess the letters of a randomly chosen National Park or nature themed word. To guess a letter, players can click on letters on the webpage, or they can press a letter on their keyboard.

### Requirements
In order to play the game, players simply need to have an internet connection and navigate to https://jsills3110.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/.

### Features

##### Accepts Multiple Inputs
Players can either click on a button representing a letter, or they can press a key that represents that letter.

##### Limited Number of Guesses
The number of guesses available per word is dependent on the length of the word. If players can't guess what the word is before 
they run out of guesses, then they lose that round!

##### Guess Full Word
If a player knows what the word is and doesn't want to keep guessing individual letters (or they will run out of guesses before 
they get the full word!), then they can type in the full word to guess it. If they guess incorrectly, it counts as one guess.

##### Hints
Players can ask for a hint, which counts as one of their guesses, but gives them a correct letter in the word.

##### Get a New Word
Instead of suffering through a word that they know they can't guess, players can choose to get a new word. Choosing this counts 
as a loss.

##### Reset the Game
Clicking on "Reset Game" clears the entire game; wins, losses, current word, and previous word are cleared and the game starts 
over.

### Contributing

This project was meant to be an exercise in JavaScript for my coding bootcamp. While you are more than welcome to fork the 
repository and modify the game for yourself, I will likely not accept pull requests. However, if you choose to review the
code and you have questions or comments for me, I am more than happy to hear them! In fact, I'd love to receive feedback on 
my code. Please feel free to email me at the address listed on my Github account.
